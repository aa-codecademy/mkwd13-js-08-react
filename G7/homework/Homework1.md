# React Homework: "My Awesome Wishlist" App

Welcome to your first React homework assignment! The goal here is to apply the fundamental React concepts you've learned to build a simple, interactive "My Awesome Wishlist" application. You'll practice creating components, managing state, rendering lists, and applying styles.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Create a New Repository:** If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub specifically for your React homework assignments.

## âœ¨ Project: My Awesome Wishlist App

You're going to build an app that allows users to create and manage a simple wishlist.

### Basic Requirements (Level 1)

Your app should meet the following basic criteria:

1.  **Display a List of Wishlist Items:**

    - Initialize your app with a few hardcoded wishlist items (e.g., "New Headphones", "Fancy Coffee Machine", "Learn React Fast").
    - Each item should display its name.
    - Use a React component to represent a single wishlist item.
    - Render these items as a list.

2.  **Add New Wishlist Items:**

    - Include an input field and a button for users to add new items.
    - When the "Add" button is clicked, the text from the input field should be added as a new item to the wishlist.
    - The input field should clear after an item is added.
    - **Hint:** You'll need to use `useState` to manage the input field's value and the list of items.

3.  **Basic Styling:**

    - Apply some basic CSS to make your app look presentable. This could be simple colors, spacing, or font sizes.

4.  **Component Structure:**
    - Think about how to break your application into sensible React components (e.g., an `App` component, a `WishlistItem` component, maybe an `AddItemForm` component).
    - Pass data between components using props where necessary.

### Bonus Requirements (Level 2 - Optional, but encouraged!)

If you've completed the basic requirements and feel comfortable, try to implement these additional features:

1.  **Remove Items:**

    - Add a "Remove" or "Delete" button next to each item.
    - When clicked, the item should be permanently removed from the wishlist.

2.  **Clear All Items:**

    - Add a button that, when clicked, removes all items

## ðŸ“¦ Submission

Once you're finished (or when the deadline approaches):

1.  **Commit Your Changes:** Make sure all your code changes are committed to your `my-wishlist-app` project within your repository.
2.  **Push to GitHub:** Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed My Awesome Wishlist App homework"
    git push
    ```
3.  **Share the Link:** Send the link to your repository to the trainer and assistant via email. You can find our email addresses in the shared classroom repository documentation.

Good luck and have fun building your app! We're excited to see what you create.
