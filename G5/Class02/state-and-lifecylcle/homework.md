# React Todo App Homework

## Objective
Create a simple Todo application using React functional components and hooks to practice working with state and lifecycle concepts.

## Requirements

### Basic Functionality
1. Create a Todo app with a list of at least 2 hardcoded todos displayed on screen.
2. Each todo should have the following properties:
   - `id`: A unique identifier
   - `description`: The task description
   - `isDone`: Boolean value (initially `false`)
3. Implement an input field and a "Create Todo" button.
4. When the button is clicked, a new todo should be added to the list and displayed on the screen.

### Structure
- Organize your code however you prefer.


### Styling
- Style the application as you wish using CSS.
- Make sure the UI is user-friendly and appealing.

## BONUS Challenge
- Add a "FINISH" button on each todo card.
- When clicked, the button should update the todo's `isDone` property to `true`.
- If a todo is marked as done (`isDone: true`), style the todo card by making the description text green or adding a green border to indicate completion.

## Tips
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the todos list state.
- Remember to use the functional approach for updating state.
- Don't forget to assign unique IDs to new todos.
- Use conditional rendering for the completed todo styling.

## Submission
- Push your code to the repository by the next class.
- Make sure your app runs without errors.

Good luck! ðŸš€
